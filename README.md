# First wxWidgets app
### A template I use to start a new GUI app

I have just begun learning [wxWidgets](wxwidgets.org) GUI library.  By watching OttoBotCode on Youtube, I have set up this basic template of a single panel GUI app with several example controls.

I run all of my GUI apps on Linux, but the CMAKELists.txt included here is almost the default from the downloaded library.  It should build on Windows and Mac, but I can't attest to that.  You would be on your own if you tried using this repository.

Always, use at your own risk.
